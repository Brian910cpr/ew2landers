Placeholders (fun, not goofy)
=================================

This pack intentionally references placeholder PNGs so the site looks 'alive' even before you swap in final images.

Drop images here when you're ready:
  docs/assets/images/course/{COURSE_NUMBER}.png   (primary course hero)
  docs/assets/images/placeholders/hero-fun.png    (index hero)
  docs/assets/images/placeholders/course-fun.png  (fallback hero)

Naming rule:
  - Use the Enrollware course number (digits) as filename.
  - Example: docs/assets/images/course/209811.png

Why:
  - easy to automate
  - easy to replace later without changing HTML
  - keeps your "chase pretty" phase decoupled from the build system
