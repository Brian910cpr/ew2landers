It's perfect for workplaces that need both credentials to meet insurance or licensing requirements. Participants complete an online course and then attend a brief in-person skills session with an authorized HSI instructor. Once registered, students receive a link to the online portion, which covers adult CPR, AED use, First Aid basics, and professional-level BLS topics such as team response, airway support, and high-performance compressions. After completing the online section, students attend a short in-person session to demonstrate hands-on skills and receive real-time feedback. Course Highlights: One card covers both Adult First Aid and BLS Ideal for professional offices, medical/dental staff, and facilities requiring dual compliance Complete the online course at your own pace Attend a 30\u201360 minute in-person skills session Earn a two-year HSI certification upon successful completion This little-known 'combo' class was\u00a0hiding in plain sight\u2014 but, it was exactly what a local ABA center needed and didn\u2019t know existed. They were facing a $120+ per person AHA combo (Heartcode BLS + Heartsaver First Aid + skills session) just to meet TRICARE and TRILLIUM requirements. We helped them uncover this streamlined HSI alternative \u2014 and now it\u2019s available for others in the same spot. Course Options: HSI Blended Course Link: Provided after registration. Must be completed prior to your scheduled skills session. Group Option: Onsite training and flexible scheduling available for businesses or organizations with 5 or more participants. Important: Please complete the HSI online course before attending your scheduled skills session. You will need to show proof of completion at the time of your appointment. ** The HSI blended course link is non-refundable once issued. ** Cancellation Policy: You may reschedule your in-person session once with 48-hour notice.
